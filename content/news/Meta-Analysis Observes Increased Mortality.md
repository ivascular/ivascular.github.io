**London, April 25th, 2018 – EFFPAC RCT 12-month outstanding results with Luminor DCB have been revealed at CX Symposium 2018.**

The 12-month results from the full clinical cohort of the EFFPAC randomized controlled trial (RCT), were presented for the first time at CX Symposium 2018 at the DCB session on April 24th.

Main objective was to assess the effectiveness of Luminor drug coated balloon (DCB) vs. Uncoated balloon catheter (POBA), in the superficial femoral and popliteal arteries. The EFFPAC RCT 12-month outcomes are all demonstrating high statistical significance versus POBA, therefore confirming and even maintaining, the already excellent 6-month outcomes:
